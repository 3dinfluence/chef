# How to Contribute

## Prerequisites
* Create an account on our [bug tracker](http://tickets.opscode.com)
* Sign our contributor agreement (CLA). You can [sign it
online](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PJIF5694K6L).
It only takes a few minutes, and you don't give away rights to your
contribution. If you're contributing on behalf of your employer, have
your employer fill out our [Corporate
CLA](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PIE6C7AX856)

## Submitting Your Patch
* Create a ticket for your change. This helps us track the changes in
each release and give you credit when your contribution ships.
* When your patch is ready, mark the ticket as resolved on the ticket
tracker. Include a link to your patch (github branch, pull request) in
your comment.
* If you're submitting a pull request, be sure to reference the ticket
number in your pull request.
